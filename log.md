# Project Log

## What's Done:

*   **Basic Project Setup:** The project is set up with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and other UI libraries.
*   **UI Components:** A variety of UI components (buttons, cards, forms, tables, etc.) have been created using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Layout:** Basic layout components like `Header`, `SidebarNav`, and `DashboardLayout` are in place.
*   **Tournament Management:**
    *   Creating, editing, and deleting tournaments.
    *   Managing event categories (add, edit, delete).
    *   Managing players within event categories (add, remove, update).
    *   Generating knockout draws (first round only).
    *   Scheduling matches (setting time and court).
    *   Setting match scores and determining winners.
*   **Public Tournament Listing and Details:** Public-facing pages to list tournaments and view tournament details.
*   **State Management:** Using React Context (`TournamentContext`) to manage tournament data.
*   **i18n:** Implement Vietnamese for most static text but need to do it for data
*   **Persistence:** Using LocalStorage to save Tournament data
*   **UI:** Using Shadcn UI

## What's Remaining:

*   **Complete Draw Generation:** The current draw generation logic only creates the first round of matches. Logic is needed to automatically generate subsequent rounds based on match outcomes (winners advancing).
*   **User Authentication and Roles:** There is currently no authentication or user roles.
*   **Data Persistence (Beyond Local Storage):** Local Storage is not suitable for production. Firebase or another database integration is needed for persistent data storage.
*   **Real-time Updates:** If you want to display live scores or updates, you'll need to implement real-time functionality (e.g., using Firebase Realtime Database or WebSockets).
*   **Input Validation:** More robust validation on forms is needed
*   **Testing:** No unit or integration tests have been written.
*   **Responsiveness:** While the layout uses some responsive techniques, a thorough review and testing on various devices is needed.
*   **Accessibility:** While Radix UI components are generally accessible, you should still perform accessibility audits.
